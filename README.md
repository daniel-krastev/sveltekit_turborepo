# Monorepo SvelteKit Apps using Turborepo

This repository serves as an example setup for a monorepo SvelteKit applications using Turborepo.

The setup includes:

- Common configurations for TypeScript and ESLint, ensuring consistent coding practices across all applications within the monorepo.
- A common Svelte component library, promoting component reuse and reducing code duplication.
- Two common libraries, further enhancing code reuse and maintainability.

By using this setup, you can efficiently manage multiple SvelteKit applications within a single repository, leveraging the power of Turborepo, TypeScript, ESLint, and Svelte.
